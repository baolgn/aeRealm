# aeRealm - Design Document
# 1. Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>
Welcome to the design document for aeRealm, an aespa fansite designed to provide a rich and interactive experience for fans. The design incorporates modern web development practices, ensuring responsiveness, accessibility, and an engaging user interface. This document aims to provide a detailed technical tour of the project, explaining the architecture, implementation choices, and design decisions made during the development.

<br>

# 2. Architecture Overview<a name="architecture-overview"></a>
aeRealm follows a client-server architecture, with the server implemented using Node.js and Express.js. The real-time features are facilitated by Socket.io, allowing instant updates for likes, shares, and comments.

<br>

# 3. Server-Side Implementation<a name="server-side-implementation"></a>
## Express.js Setup<a name="express-js-setup"></a>
The server is created using Express.js, a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework. The `app.js` file initializes the Express app, sets up static file serving, and defines middleware for handling JSON payloads.
```
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;
const httpServer = require('http').Server(app);
```

## Middleware Configuration<a name="middleware-configuration"></a>
Middleware is employed for serving static files from the 'public' directory and parsing incoming requests with JSON payloads.
```
app.use(express.static('public'));
app.use(express.json());
```

## Error Handling<a name="error-handling"></a>
In case of undefined routes, a simple 404 error message is returned to the client.
```
app.use((req, res) => {
    res.status(404).send('<h1>Error 404: Resource not found</h1>');
});

httpServer.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

<br>

# 4. Real-time Updates with Socket.io<a name="real-time-updates-with-socket-io"></a>
## Socket.io Setup<a name="socket-io-setup"></a>
Socket.io is utilized for real-time bidirectional event-based communication. In `socket.js`, a client connection is established, and the 'postUpdated' event is listened for.
```
const io = require('socket.io-client');
const socket = io();
```

## Event Handling<a name="event-handling"></a>
When a 'postUpdated' event is received, the client dynamically updates the like and share counts on the frontend. Additionally, the post timestamp is updated using the `updatePostTime` function.
```
socket.on('postUpdated', (post) => {
    document.getElementById(`likesCount${post.id}`).textContent = `${post.likes} Likes`;
    document.getElementById(`sharesCount${post.id}`).textContent = `${post.shares} Shares`;
    updatePostTime(post.id, post.timestamp);
});
```

<br>

# 5. Database Interactions<a name="database-interactions"></a>
## Post-related Functions<a name="post-related-functions"></a>
The `post.js` module handles interactions with the database. Functions like `addComment`, likePost, and `sharePost` perform `SQL queries` to update post-related information in the database.

## Time Calculation<a name="time-calculation"></a>
The `updatePostTime` function calculates the time difference between the current time and the post's timestamp, dynamically updating the displayed post time based on the elapsed time.

<br>

# 6. Client-Side Implementation<a name="client-side-implementation"></a>
## Socket.io Client<a name="socket-io-client"></a>
On the client side, the `socket.io-client` library is used to establish a connection with the server. This connection enables real-time communication and updates.

## Post Interactions<a name="post-interactions"></a>
The `interactPost` function handles user interactions with posts, sending POST requests to the server's API endpoint to update likes and shares.
```
function interactPost(postId, interactionType) {
    fetch(`/api/posts/${postId}/${interactionType}`, {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
    })
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => console.log(data))
    .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
}
```

## Comments Section<a name="comments-section"></a>
The `showComments` function fetches comments for a post from the server's API and dynamically updates the comments section on the webpage.
```
function showComments(postId) {
    fetch(`/api/posts/${postId}/comments`)
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        const commentsSection = document.getElementById(`commentsSection${postId}`);
        commentsSection.innerHTML = '<strong>Comments:</strong>';

        if (data.comments.length === 0) {
            commentsSection.innerHTML += '<p>No comments yet.</p>';
        } else {
            data.comments.forEach(comment => {
                commentsSection.innerHTML += `<p>${comment.text}</p>`;
            });
        }
    })
    .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
}
```
